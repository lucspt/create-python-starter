# Welcome!

Hey, this is our package documentation, make yourself at home!

If this is your first time here, we recommended to first start with
reading the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file located in the project repo,
and then the guides:

- [Application routes](./guides/routes.md)
- [Schemas](./guides/schemas.md)
- [Testing](./guides/testing.md)

Besides that, go crazy! You own this codebase just as much as any other
contributor does, so don't be afraid to show it 😁❗️
